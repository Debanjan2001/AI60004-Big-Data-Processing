mama, just killed a man,
put a gun against his head
pulled my trigger, now he's dead
 life had just begun
but now I've gone and thrown it all away
mama, ooh,
didn't mean to make you cry,
if I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
too late, my time has come,
sends shivers down my spine,
body's aching all the time
goodbye everybody, I've got to go,
gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows),
I don't want to die,
